Exercise from Python PRO course module 4.

Scraping https://www.w3schools.io/file/yaml-sample-example/ for a YAML file, getting the comments from the page with REGEX then making my own YAML file.


During development I tried using a dict to create the YAML file, howerver I was confuse since dict require Keys:Value and some of the data from the example YAML file were only normal sentences.So I decided to use a normal list.
